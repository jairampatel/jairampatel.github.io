Play Along is a small, compact Chrome extension that is activated when you listen to music on YouTube. Once the YouTube video is loaded, Play Along will search Ultimate Guitar for the corresponding chords and tabs. If no match is found, clicking on the "Chords" and "Tabs" buttons will open up the search page in Ultimate Guitar.

In addition to Ultimate Guitar, users also have the option of navigating to the Chordify page.
