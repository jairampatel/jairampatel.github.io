Good Plates is a minimalist recipe website that removes choice paralysis by showing a single recipe at a time to users based on their preferences. 

The frontend is written in Typescript and hosted on Netlify. The backend leverages API Gateway and AWS Lambda for routing requests. The recipes are stored in a custom B-Tree implementation on top of DynamoDB.
