Rebound is a game with multi-colored balls bouncing around. By playing this game, you will improve your ability to multi-task and focus on multiple things at once.

### How to play

All balls will have a number on them. When balls bounce against the wall, that number will decrease. When the ball value has gone down to one, you must press on one of the four wall quadrants to let the ball through. Only balls with a value of one will go through the wall. If a quadrant is pressed for any other ball, the game is over. If the quadrant is not pressed when the value is one, the game is over.

One-balls will change colors as your score goes up. The difficulty ramps up pretty quickly and keeping track of multiple balls can be challenging.
