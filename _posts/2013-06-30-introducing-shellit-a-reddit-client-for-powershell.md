title: "Introducing Shellit, a Reddit client for PowerShell"
---

A few weeks ago, I had the idea of making a Reddit client for PowerShell. One of the reasons for making Shellit was you can browse Reddit and look like you’re working that I hadn’t done much scripting in PowerShell before. Plus it gave me a chance to finally start making my own repositories on Github.

Shellit is extremely primitive. Currently, users can:

* Login if they want to
* Navigate through different pages of reddit
* Open links in the PowerShell window
* View comments on self posts


Some of the improvements I’ll probably make in my next update will be to:

Allow users to view comments for all posts
Warn the user when the link tries to open an image/video (you can’t view an image/video in the PowerShell window).
Improve the html rendering in the PowerShell window
Shellit is open source and you can contribute to it on Github [here](https://github.com/J-rom/Shellit)
